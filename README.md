There are 4 source systems in this project from where we need to load data in python data
frames,
All these source systems are some third party databases, and have similar schema. For one of
the source that is CSV_s1, we also got source schema extract to understand the fields’
definition.
Note – Same schema is applicable for all 4 source systems datasets.
Each data source system contains 3 types of datasets named Customers, Products, and
Transactions.
